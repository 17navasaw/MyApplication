Proposed level of achievement: Gemini 
 
Project Scope: 

NUS Students (College Students)
 
Problem motivation:
 
In NUS Library, we have a whole collection of past year papers for students. However, professors usually will not release the solutions of all the papers. Many students are unmotivated to do the papers because they would prefer to have answers. Our app hopes to pool student’s answers together so that students can have a reference for their own workings. 
 
Proposed features of our system:
 
Uploading of answers
Students can upload their answers to be stored in the database, sorted by modules and year. Students will take a picture of the workings they have done through their android devices.
Forum for Discussion
A forum can be set up for every paper to facilitate discussion
Checking of answers
Students can only access other student’s answers if they have uploaded their own answers. This is to prevent leechers. If spams are uploaded, other students can report the student and that spammer will be banned.
Request Professor help
If enough students requested for professor’s help, an automated email will be sent to the professor to help address that question
